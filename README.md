# GreenSplit

Greensplit is an open source application written in C++ and Qt for calculating fast payment of group expenses.  It has both desktop and mobile versions.

----

Example Use Case:  

 - You, Mark, Susan and Charlie go on a ski trip.  
 - You pay for the rental house covering everyone on the trip.  
 - Susan buys the beverages, but Charlie doesn't drink, so it only covers three of you.  
 - Mark drives Susan and Charlie using his car and pays for gas covering the three of them.  
 
    
*What is the fastest way to settle everyone's debt in this situation?*

This project also served as a learning exercise for me.  My goals were.

 - Learn the three components of Qt: Core, Widgets and QML
 - Create a project that can be built as a Widgets/Desktop application or a QML/Mobile application with a common Qt core.
 - Have the Qt Core adapt a raw C++ back end.
